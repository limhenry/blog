I using Android phone, because it is nice and good. But not just the hardware make my Android phone nice but apps.

Today I am going to introduce some of my favorite apps.

#Google Now Launcher

Google Now Launcher is developed by Google. It is useful if you are Google Now daily user (hourly?) because this launcher allow user to ‘swipe right to Google Now’. This allow me to access to Google Now even faster than ‘swipe up to Google Now’. This is definitely my favorite launcher. It’s fast and beautiful. 

By the way,the latest version of Google Now Launcher have the new Material Design (but no that awesome animation) for Android 4.1 - Android 4.4. Of course, Android 5.0/5.1 will include that animation (ripple effect?).

Why I not using other launcher like Nova, Apex or stock launcher? This Google Now Launcher is the only launcher makes my phone looks like stock Android. I prefer clean design, and Google Now Launcher is what I need.

#OfficeSuite 8#

This app is like a full Microsoft Office for your Android phone/tablet. It have almost all features you need. You can do everything in Office Suite 8. You can create and view .docx, .xlsx., .pptx, etc. files with this apps. You also can insert image into your document file (this is impossible to do it in [Google Docs](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.docs.editors.docs). 

Actually, I using the Office Suite Pro 8 right now, so I can access to all their awesome features. Anyway, I didn’t brought it (not pirated thanks) but I get it FREE from Amazon App Store (sorry, that promotion ended long long time ago). 

Anyway, no matter it’s free version of paid (pro) version, it’s still a powerful app. Er, of course, the paid version is still the best. Yes, it’s better than Google Docs/Slide/Sheet.

#Heads-up notifications#

You need this app if you are not running Android 5.0 (Lollipop users, you got this feature already, shh, don’t show off/hao-lian).

Google introduced the new Notification design for Android 5.0, Lollipop. It’s nice and make your notification more visible, accessible, and configurable.

Unfortunately, that’s only exclusive for Lollipop. Thanks to Heads-up notifications, those using Android 4.4 and below will also have the ability to enjoy this beautiful pop-up (heads-up) notification. 

This app is highly customizable so you also can choose which app to show in heads-up notification or when notification will not show.

Conclusion: this app is totally free and download now! 
Note: it’s also open source and available in [GitHub](https://github.com/SimenCodes/heads-up/)
