It's time to write something again.

Today, nothing special and important to write. But, I am excited to announce that the domain of this website is moved to [limhenry.me](http://limhenry.me). Short URL, easier to remember!

Anyway, you still can visit limhenry.github.io but it will redirect automatically to limhenry.me

Just change to domain, all posts still remain same.

I am going to write a very special review (story, something like that) and post it maybe tomorrow (evening, hopefully).

Stay tuned and remember to subscribe to my [newsletter](http://eepurl.com/bdrwRz)

Again, feel free to visit [limhenry.me](limhenry.me). And wish you Happy Chinese New Year, Huat Ah! (is that too early?)

*PS: sometime, can you disable your AdBlock when you visit this blog? ^^
